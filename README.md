# BulletGame
A work in progress game with bullet physics made in WPF.

Currently have - working movement for a hitbox for the player character.
Different forms of attacks that can be created at any location by hitting a button.
Pushing A. adds enemies that spawn. Z is the button to shoot.

Working towards:
Making enemies follow a level based pattern.
Reduce visual strain.
Will update everytime I push a new update.
